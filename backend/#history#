Lost Worlds - The Vikings

The Vikings were sophisticated sailors. Viking graves show that the Vikings were often after loot from their enemies. Not only after loot, the Vikings did in fact trade as well. Proof of this was a Bhudda icon found in grave, which is not a recorded place where the vikings attacked or looted. Vikings tactics were to be quick; to kill, loot, and then burn and leave. 

The name of Viking was given to a whole civilization, however it only applied to a few. To go viking, meant to go raiding. The other members of the civilization were not militant at all. Many common folk vikings were traders. The members of the raiding vikings were like members of a mafia. 

The viking longship was an elite boat which the vikings used to sail the seas. These ships used large masts, which would double their speed that they would achieve from rowing. These longships were designed to travel extremely far.  These boats were also designed to look intimidating to the viking's enemies. 

The vikings success was owed to their master of the sea. The vikings did not just disappear; they simple evolved into a whole new culture over time.
